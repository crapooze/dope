* specs
* static file handler
  - create a relevant context to be instantiated instead of current single object
* export resource models 
  - relations: get the data from the relationship:
    -> currently values to iterate on are passed as parameters
    -> we could get them from the relationship
    -> ideally, the model could also be taken internally from the relationship
* use perspectives in the handlers
  - possibility to export one resource with a limited number of perspectives?
* (unlikely) case which may break
  - multiple nesting of similar resources 
    -> consider it or not?
* other HTTP actions than GET
* logging
