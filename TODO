* specs
* static file handler
  - create a class generator instead of current one and only one static approach
  - better mime-types handling
* export resource models 
  - relations: get the data from the relationship:
      -> currently values to iterate on are passed as parameters
      -> we could get them from the relationship
      -> ideally, the model could also be taken internally
  - epithet
      -> handler for epithet, current model handler uses match?, we will need to use
          epithet_resource_match_params?
* use perspectives in the handlers
  - possibility to export one resource with a limited number of perspectives?
* (unlikely) case which may break
  - multiple nesting of similar resources => risk of parameter namespacing issue?
