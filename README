= Dope

Dope is a way to publish Welo resources over a Derailleur HTTP server.  Welo
provides all the path naming logic, and Derailleur provides a fast lookup for
routes. Dope builds higher level logic on top of these two blocks. In a few
sentences, Dope provides handlers for Resources. Dope introduces Resources'
Views. It also gives handlers for static assets.

Nota-Bene: current status is still quite unstable, use with care.
Any proposal/ideas for improvements will be welcomed.

== Dope::Application
A Dope::Application is just a Derailleur::Application with more methods to
export and receive resources. A dope application uses ResourceHandler to handle
incoming requests.

== Dope::Resource
A Dope::Resource is just a Welo::Resource with a view.
